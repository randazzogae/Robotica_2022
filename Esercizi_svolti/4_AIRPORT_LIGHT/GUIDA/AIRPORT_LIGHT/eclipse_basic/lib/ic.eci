Its allows modelling problems involving\n   integer variables, continuous (real) variables, or a mixture of those.\n   A variety of linear and nonlinear constraints are supported.  Additional\n   global constraints over the same variable domain are provided by separate\n   libraries of the ic_xxx family.\n</P><P>\n   The integer variables and constraints are similar to those available\n   in traditional finite-domain solvers (such as the old `fd' library).\n   Constraints which are not specifically integer constraints can be\n   applied to either real or integer variables (or a mix) seamlessly.\n   Crucially, an integer variable is just a real variable with an\n   additional integrality constraint.\n</P><P>\n   For more information, see the IC section of the Constraint Library Manual\n   or the documentation for the individual IC predicates.\n</P><P>\n   The solver is loaded either interactively by typing <CODE>lib(ic)</CODE>\n   at the query prompt, or, more commonly, by having a\n<PRE>\n        :- lib(ic).\n</PRE>\n   directive at the beginning of a program.\n</P>\n<H3>Variables and Domains</H3>\n<P>\n   The central notion of the solver is the domain variable; this is a\n   variable than is constrained to take only numeric values in a given domain.\n   It is advisable to declare every variable via a domain constraint.\n   For real-valued variables, initial bounds should be given, e.g.\n<PRE>\n        ?- X $:: 0.0..4.5.\n        X = X{0.0..4.5}\n</PRE>\n   Similarly for integer variables, but here a more precise domain may\n   be given in the form of a list of elements or intervals:\n<PRE>\n        ?- X #:: 0..5.\n        X = X{0..5}\n\n        ?- X #:: [0..3,5,8..9].\n        X = X{[0..3,5,8,9]}\n</PRE>\n   Binary (0/1) variables are a special case of integers:\n<PRE>\n        ?- B #:: 0..1.\n        B = B{0..1}\n</PRE>\n   As a general convention, the #-forms of constraints indicate that\n   the constraint imposes integrality, while the $-forms do not.\n   Note how domain variables are printed with their domain in curly\n   brackets (the domain is a part of the variable's attributes).\n</P><P>\n   Collections of variables (such as lists, arrays, matrices) can be\n   given a domain together:\n<PRE>\n        ?- dim(Xs,[4]), Xs #:: 0..5.\n        Xs = [](_432{0..5}, _446{0..5}, _460{0..5}, _474{0..5})\n</PRE>\n   If no a-priori bounds are known, use infinity (written as 1.0Inf or inf),\n   or use the pure type-constraints reals/1 or integers/1.  Often, when the\n   variables get implicitly bounded by the other constraints they occur in,\n   domain constraints can be omitted altogether,\n</P>\n\n<H3>Basic arithmetic constraints</H3>\n<P>\n   The basic arithmetic constraints are equalities ($=), inequalities\n   ($<, $=<, $>=, $>) and disequalities ($\\=).  These all have #-forms\n   (#=, #<, #=<, #>=, #>, #\\=) that require all variables, constants and\n   intermediate result to be integral.\n</P><P>\n   The following arithmetic expressions can be used in these constraints:\n   <DL>\n   <DT><STRONG><CODE>X</CODE></STRONG><DD>\n\t    Variables.

They can be written either with\n   explicit additions and multiplications, such as in the cryptarithmetic\n   example below:\n<PRE>\n                     1000*S + 100*E + 10*N + D\n                   + 1000*M + 100*O + 10*R + E\n        #= 10000*M + 1000*O + 100*N + 10*E + Y\n</PRE>\n   but are often written using scalar product notation, as in this\n   subset-sum problem:\n<PRE>\n    model(Amounts) :-\n        Total = 1505,\n        Prices = [215, 275, 335, 355, 420, 580],\n        length(Prices, N),\n        length(Amounts, N),\n        Amounts #:: 0..Total//min(Prices),\n        sum(Amounts*Prices) #= Total.           % scalar product\n</PRE>\n   However, this library is not limited to linear constraints,\n   so it can be used to solve general problems like:\n   <PRE>\n   ?- ln(X) $>= sin(X).\n   X = X{0.36787944117144228 .. 1.0Inf}\n   </PRE>\n   <P>\n</P>\n\n<H3>Reified Constraints</H3><P>\n   All the basic constraints have reified versions.  This means they can\n   not only be used as normal constraints, but they can occur in arithmetic\n   or logical expressions, where they represent their truth value in the\n   form of a 0 or 1.  For example:\n<PRE>\n        ?- X #:: 1..3,  B #= (X#<4).\n        X = X{1..3}\n        B = 1\n</PRE>\n   By setting the boolean to 0, the negation of the constraint can be enforced:\n<PRE>\n        ?- 0 #= (X#<4).\n        X = X{4..1.0Inf}\n</PRE>\n   The feature is especially useful for modelling logical connectives such\n   as disjunction, which are otherwise difficult to handle, e.g.\n<PRE>\n        ?- (X #=< 5) or (X #>=8), X=7.\n        No (0.00s cpu)\n</PRE>\n</P>\n\n<H3>Other Constraints</H3>\n<P>\n   The basic IC library implements only a few other constraints,\n   such as element/3 (a constraint version of indexed array access),\n   circuit/1, piecewise_linear/3, and a basic form of alldifferent/1.\n   Most more complex constraints are provided in separate libraries,\n   such as ic_global and ic_global_gac.\n</P><P>\n   The library ic_kernel contains low-level primitives useful for\n   implementing user-defined constraints.\n</P>\n\n<H3>Search</H3>\n<P>\n   Once a problem has been modelled with domain variables and constraints,\n   it can be solved by search.  This means looking for variable assignments\n   that satisfy the constraints, usually by non-deterministically exploring\n   the different domain values that the variables can take.  The library\n   provides labeling/1 and search/6 for integer variables, and locate/4\n   for real variables, among others.\n</P><P>\n   For the implementation of custom search routines, the get_xxx predicates\n   provide access to information about variable domains.\n</P>\n\n<H3>Implementation details and Pitfalls</H3>\n<P>\n   User-defined functions/constraints are treated in a similar manner to\n   user defined functions found in expressions handled by is/2.  Note,\n   however, that user defined constraints/functions, when used in IC, should\n   be (semi-)deterministic.  User defined constraints/functions which leave\n   choice points may not behave as expected.\n</P><P>\n   Linear constraints are handled by a single propagator, whereas non-linear\n   constraints are broken down into simpler ternary/binary/unary\n   propagators.  The value of any constraint found in an expression is its\n   reified truth value (0..1).\n</P><P>\n   Variables appearing in arithmetic IC constraints at compile-time are\n   assumed to be IC variables unless they are wrapped in an <STRONG>eval/1</STRONG>\n   term.  The <STRONG>eval/1</STRONG> wrapper inside arithmetic constraints is used to\n   indicate that a variable will be bound to an expression at run-time.\n   This feature will only be used by programs which generate their\n   constraints dynamically at run-time, for example.\n   <PRE>\n   broken_sum(Xs,Sum):-\n       (\n\t   foreach(X,Xs),\n\t   fromto(Expr,S1,S2,0)\n       do\n\t   S1 = X + S2\n       ),\n       Sum $= Expr.\n   </PRE>\n   The above implementation of a summation constraint will not work as\n   intended because the variable <TT>Expr</TT> will be treated like an IC\n   variable when it is in fact the term <TT>+(X1,+(X2,+(...)))</TT> which is\n   constructed in the for-loop.  In order to get the desired functionality,\n   one must wrap the variable <TT>Expr</TT> in an <STRONG>eval/1</STRONG>.\n   <PRE>\n   working_sum(Xs,Sum):-\n       (\n\t   foreach(X,Xs),\n\t   fromto(Expr,S1,S2,0)\n       do\n\t   S1 = X + S2\n       ),\n       Sum $= eval(Expr).\n   </PRE>\n</P>\n")).

In order to allow more\nstructure in the application program, it is possible to pass a collection\nof terms rather than only a collection of domain variables. In this way all\ninformation about some entity can be easily grouped together. It also\nallows more complex labeling methods which combine the assignment of\nmultiple variables (like a preference value and a decision variable).\n\n<p>\nAll search methods use a <i>stable</i> selection method.

This method is typically\n\tused if the variable represents a cost, and we are interested in\n\tthe choice which could increase overall cost the most if the best\n\tpossibility is not taken.
